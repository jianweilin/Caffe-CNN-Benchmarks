## Descriptions

This model is a 4 layer [Network in Network](http://openreview.net/document/9b05a3bb-3a5e-49cb-91f7-0f482af65aea) model trained on imagenet dataset.

Thanks to the replacement of fully connected layer with a global average pooling layer, this model has greatly reduced parameters,
which results in a snapshot of size 29MB, compared to AlexNet which is about 230MB, it is one eighth the size.

The top 1 performance of this model on validation set is 59.36%, which is slightly better than AlexNet.
(Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) * 2 mirror, should obtain a bit higher accuracy.)

The training time of the model is also greatly reduced compared to AlexNet because of the faster convergence.
It takes 4-5 days to train on a GTX Titan.
